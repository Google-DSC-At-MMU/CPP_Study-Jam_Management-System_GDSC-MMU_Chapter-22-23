This is the code repo of Part 2 of our C++ Study Jam! 

In this event, we teach you not only the basics of C++, but we also go into a project which utilises all of the basics we'll teach you!  This session is taught by Mr. Taki Eddine! Mr. Taki Eddine is the previous President of Google DSC @ University Sains Malaysia (USM)! Taki also serves as an unofficial advisor for GDSC@MMU where his experience and advice is invaluable!
